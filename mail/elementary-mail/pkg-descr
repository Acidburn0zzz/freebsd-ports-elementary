Mail is designed to let you manage your email quickly and effortlessly.
Its interface is based on conversations, so you can read an entire
discussion without having to click from message to message.

* Lightweight client with full IMAP support
* Multiple account support
* Inline HTML composer that saves drafts to the server
* As-you-type searching
* Mail grouped into conversations, not a tree of threads
